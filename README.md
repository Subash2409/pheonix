## Food Data Fusion: Integrating Food & Drug Administration, Food Inspection, Nutrients, and Foodborne Disease Outbreaks for Enhanced Food Safety Analysis

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to integrate multiple datasets related to food safety, including data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), food inspection records, nutrient data, and disease outbreak reports, to enhance food safety analysis. ETL operations are then performed on the data and visualizations are done on the resultant data.
